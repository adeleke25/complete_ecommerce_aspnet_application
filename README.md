## Add DbContext file:
DbContext is a central class in Entity Framework (EF), an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET applications. It acts as a bridge between the application and the database, enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations on entities in an object-oriented manner
## Key Responsibilities of DbContext:
# Database Interaction: It provides APIs to query the database, execute commands, and track changes to entities.
# Entity Management: It manages the lifecycle of entities, such as adding, updating, and deleting objects.
# Change Tracking: It keeps track of changes made to objects so that when you call SaveChanges(), it knows which entities need to be inserted, updated, or deleted in the database.
# Data Access: It allows for querying the database using LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and also allows execution of raw SQL queries when needed.
# Migration Support: It can handle database migrations, making it easy to evolve your database schema over time as your application's model changes.
